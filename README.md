A service mesh implementation based on [go chassis](https://github.com/go-chassis/go-chassis).

One big advantage of Mesher is it is able to 
work with go-chassis in same service mesh control plane like Istio. Without Istio they can work 
together with ServiceComb Service center and running on any infrastructure(docker, VM, baremetal). 
So if you choose go as your programing language, you can use go-chassis to gain better performance, and you can freely use 
other programing language which suit your service the most

Mesher support both linux and windows OS, 
that makes possible that .Net service can work with java, go, python service in one distributed system easily

# Features
- go-chassis: Mesher has all of features of [go chassis](https://github.com/go-chassis/go-chassis)
a go micro service framework
- Admin APIï¼šListen on isolated port, let user to query runtime information 


# Get started
Refer to [mesher-examples](https://github.com/go-mesh/mesher-examples)

### How to build and run
#### Build from scratch
1. Install ServiceComb [service-center](https://github.com/ServiceComb/service-center/releases)

2. build and run, use go mod(go 1.11+, experimental but a recommended way)
```shell
cd mesher
GO111MODULE=on go mod download
#optional
GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor
go build mesher.go
./mesher
```
####Build script
```bash
cd build
./build_proxy.sh

```
it will build binary and docker image
- tar file: release/mesher-latest-linux-amd64.tar
- docker: servicecomb/mesher:latest
